We have a mental health channel in slack, mental health benefits are often and openly discussed, both in-patient and out-patient services. Folks are encouraged to take mental health days if necessary and encouraged to discuss what they're going through with others. That being said, the company is facing a tough financial time so recently, the encouragement to take PTO, etc. has decreased and stress level has increased.","It was a little difficult for me to answer some of the questions related to mental health disorders because something like post-partum related issues are often for a short period of time so it's not a lifelong depression or something you struggle with all the time, but it is a huge mental health issue (and something that's generally not covered by insurance making it even more difficult to provide resources for).","33","female","United States of America","Maryland","White","United States of America","Maryland",2017

Nothing was getting done because I couldn't focus.  My anxiety was going crazy because I felt like I was letting everyone down, and that was making it harder and harder to come into the office.  Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation. Additionally, between the Project Manager and my manager, we ensured there weren't too many tickets assigned in my backlog as well, to reduce the sense of an unending series of tasks piling up.","Maybe","1","Just identified that I knew I was going through a phase of depression, and that I appreciated that they were reacting kindly despite my terrible attitude","0",NA,6,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1","1","No, none did","N/A (none offered)","None did","None did","I don't know","Same level of comfort for each","Some of my previous supervisors",1,"A very long and difficult depression episode led to me dropping down to 50% time for a few months while I worked my way through it","At some of my previous employers",0,NA,"0",NA,"5","5","Yes","Yes","Possibly",1,"Yes","Rarely","N/A","7","Maybe",NA,"No","tech is club where any sort of weakness is unacceptable.",0,NA,NA,"Maybe/Not sure",NA,NA,"2",NA,NA,"35","female","Canada",NA,NA,"Canada",NA,2017

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness.",NA,"42","Male","White",2019,0,NA,NA,"TRUE","Some did","I was aware of some","No, at none of my previous employers","No",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rarely","Sometimes","No",5

I work in an IT consulting firm and I faced 2 burnouts, clients were to blame every-time because they were looking for code monkeys instead of software crafts·men·women that care a  about quality (the vast majority of my coworkers). My company was supportive, I had the time to put myself back together but no real solution was found (yet) to prevent consultants to be appointed to unhealthy environments. But they are working on it. In France, it's called occupational stress prevention (prévention des risques psychosociaux), many people here fell very uneasy about the term mental health, to be honest, I really don't know what to do to raise awareness about this issue.","Yes","1","It was a mixed bag. We all react differently to oppression (that lead to depression) in the workplace. Some said to me to ""man up"" some others were compassionate. I described my experiences and detailed the many defence mechanisms I developed over the years to fight against unhealthy behaviours. Oppression, alienation at work, sexism, lack of quality in our craft, lack of empathy, rejected ideas for unfair and political reasons and so on. Politics is everywhere nowadays, I believe that everyone is politically engaged and it's hard to find a common ground that allow us to move forward.","1","One of my coworker faced the same issue as me back then, I was alerted by my human resource manager to help him out. I was grateful to be part of that process and I believe I helped him to recover a bit. We discussed about the gap that exist between the corporate culture of the client he was working with and his desire as a software craftsman. I told him that it wasn't his fault, that he was doing what felt right to him, but his arguments was falling on deaf ears, they weren't interested about his expertise, they just wanted a mindless robot that can work tirelessly without asking too much questions.

I can take ""anxiety days"" when I need to. I do take them unpaid since that gives me less anxiety and then it doesn't show on the budget higher up (A large company has a small office in my country and these are all arrangements at that office.) but he is fine with me taking them as paid sick days, again my choice not to do so. All I have to do is inform my team when I'm showing up very late or not at all or working from home, it is such a relief to be able to have honest open communication and has lessened a lot of anxiety that I had about ""being sick a lot"" or if they thought I was a lazy person. My anxiety also affects my sleep a lot and now since making these adjustments I have not had to show up for work unslept and the even though I have fewer hours some weeks then I did before they are more productive and I'm happier about them.

I think open communication is also a big thing. Making sure the people that work for you know that it is okay if they have a mental illness, it made my anxiety way worse to worry about it.
