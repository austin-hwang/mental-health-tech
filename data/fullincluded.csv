First of all, sorry, English is not my main language, so please bare with me. I work in an IT consulting firm and I faced 2 burnouts, clients were to blame every-time because they were looking for code monkeys instead of software crafts·men·women that care a  about quality (the vast majority of my coworkers). My company was supportive, I had the time to put myself back together but no real solution was found (yet) to prevent consultants to be appointed to unhealthy environments. But they are working on it. In France, it's called occupational stress prevention (prévention des risques psychosociaux), many people here fell very uneasy about the term mental health, to be honest, I really don't know what to do to raise awareness about this issue.","Yes","1","It was a mixed bag. We all react differently to oppression (that lead to depression) in the workplace. Some said to me to ""man up"" some others were compassionate. I described my experiences and detailed the many defence mechanisms I developed over the years to fight against unhealthy behaviours. Oppression, alienation at work, sexism, lack of quality in our craft, lack of empathy, rejected ideas for unfair and political reasons and so on. Politics is everywhere nowadays, I believe that everyone is politically engaged and it's hard to find a common ground that allow us to move forward.","1","One of my coworker faced the same issue as me back then, I was alerted by my human resource manager to help him out. I was grateful to be part of that process and I believe I helped him to recover a bit. We discussed about the gap that exist between the corporate culture of the client he was working with and his desire as a software craftsman. I told him that it wasn't his fault, that he was doing what felt right to him, but his arguments was falling on deaf ears, they weren't interested about his expertise, they just wanted a mindless robot that can work tirelessly without asking too much questions. I told him that he was more than competent, that he was not an impostor.",7,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"No, I only became aware later","None did","None did","I don't know","Mental health","No, none of my previous supervisors","0","No, at none of my previous employers","0",NA,"0",NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Eating Disorder (Anorexia, Bulimia, etc)",NA

If your brain is not working properly, how can yo work?

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness.",NA,"42","Male","White","2019"

We've talked about my mental illness and related mental health issues, but I'd be a lot less comfortable talking about it with my new/next manager. During a period when I wasn't doing well, my manager didn't feel like they could ask about how I was doing, or about what kind of support would be helpful. They were relieved when I (without a direct ask from them) let them know that I was not actively suicidal. They talked through some options with me, and expressed that it would be okay for me to take a leave-of-absence for a mental illness (with proper documentation). 

I navigated setting up intermittent FMLA leave on my own, with the LOA company that our company outsources all LOA-related info to. Several months into this, my manager and my future manager let me know that HR is hustling to make an intermittent-LOA policy because no one else in the company of 10,000+ people has ever taken FMLA leave on an intermittent basis. I let them know that $outsource_company has been tracking my leave, and that they had no problems setting it up under the existing FMLA policies.
